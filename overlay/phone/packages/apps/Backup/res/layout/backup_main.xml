    ViewPager for swiping between tabs. We put
    LocalBackupListFragment, CloudBackupFragment
    at runtime. (Adding them directly as
    the children of this view is not recommended. ViewPager should
    be treated like a ListView, which doesn't expect children to be
    added from the layout.)
